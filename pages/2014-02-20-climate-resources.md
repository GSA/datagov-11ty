Coastal communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the risk of damage from coastal inundation. In the northeast, Hurricane Sandy was a stark reminder of the potential damage a single storm can cause. These additional resources listed below will allow you to create tools and provide information to help communities prepare for coastal inundation. Through the use of data, visualizations, and simulations, you can help people understand their exposure to coastal inundation hazards and their increased vulnerability due to population increase and sea level rise.

### Coastal Erosion and Vulnerability

* [Shoreline change, Sea-Level Vulnerability, extreme storms coastal erosion hazards](http://marine.usgs.gov/coastalchangehazardsportal/ "Shoreline change, Sea-Level Vulnerability, extreme storms coastal erosion hazards")
* [Composite Inundation Hazards for the Hurricane Sandy Impact Area](http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Roadmap/RoadmapPilot_HazardComposite/MapServer "Composite Inundation Hazards for the Hurricane Sandy Impact Area")
	+ Spatial extents of multiple flood hazard data sets combined. Flood hazard data sets include shallow coastal flooding, FEMA flood data (V zones, A zones, and 500-year zones treated as individual layers), storm surge for category 3 hurricane, and sea level rise of 3 feet above mean high tide.


### Coastal Flood Frequency

This dataset depicts the extent of flood-prone coastal areas based on predicted water levels exceeding specific tidal heights as issued by local National Weather Service offices.
