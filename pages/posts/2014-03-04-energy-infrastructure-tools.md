Here users will find web-based tools and publicly accessible models to help understand, analyze, and assess vulnerabilities and resilience of the energy sector and critical infrastructure to climate variability, global climate change, and compounding stressors. Tools include interactive mapping applications as well as navigable libraries containing scientific and technical publications, additional datasets, or models. *Note: some sections may overlap with each other as they fit in multiple criteria.*

## **Energy Resources**

* [Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework (KDF)](https://bioenergykdf.net/): The Bioenergy Library contains hundreds of publications, data sets, and models specifically related to bioenergy production, distribution, delivery, and end use. Many of the Bioenergy Library publication records include abstracts and links to full-text content, while certain data sets can be added to and visualized on the KDF Map. Users also have the ability to comment on entries and share links with others via email and social networking sites.
* [Biofuels Atlas](https://maps.nrel.gov/?da=biofuels-atlas): Provides biofuel data that can be used within a GIS application to explore biomass-to-biofuel potential at different locations and scales.

* [Energy infrastructure with real time storm information](https://www.eia.gov/special/disruptions/): The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) tracks and reports on selected significant storms that impact or could potentially impact energy infrastructure. See past historical events or real-time storm tracking with energy infrastructure maps.
* [Flood Vulnerability Assessment Map](https://atlas.eia.gov/apps/flooding/explore): Flood hazard information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been combined with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA’s) energy infrastructure layers as a tool to help state, county, city, and private sector planners assess which key energy infrastructure assets are vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges, and flash flooding. Note that flood hazard layers must be zoomed-in to street level before they become visible. For a full set of energy infrastructure layers refer to the *U.S. Energy Mapping System tool*.

* [Integrated Rapid Visual Screening Series (IRVS) for Buildings](https://www.dhs.gov/bips-04-integrated-rapid-visual-screening-series-irvs-buildings): The IRVS for Buildings categorizes 15 building types and addresses 20 hazardous events: internal (intrusion, blast and CBR); external blast and external chemical, biological, and radiological releases from 100, 300 and 1,000 feet; earthquakes (ground shaking and ground failure); floods (still water and velocity surge); wind (hurricane, tornado, and other wind events); landslide (rainfall and earthquakes); and fire (resulting from earthquakes, blast, or arson). The knowledge for calculating both risk and resilience is embedded in the tool. Major tool interactions are automatically calculated by pre-assigned weights, interaction logic, and context-based algorithms based on knowledge and tool validations. Risk is based primarily on target attractiveness (for manmade hazards). For natural hazards, it uses probability of occurrence. Risk is a product of consequences multiplied by threats multiplied by vulnerabilities. Resilience is computed from a combination of robustness, resourcefulness, and recovery factors based on information such as hardening, training, and redundancies. Information obtained from the IRVS analysis can be used by law enforcement agencies, emergency managers, facility managers, engineers and architects to support higher-level assessments and mitigation measures.
