[***Useful to Usable***](https://mygeohub.org/groups/u2u)(u2u) offers a suite of online tools created to help farmers and agricultural advisers manage increasingly variable weather and climate conditions across the Corn Belt. They provide historical climate data that help inform purchasing, marketing and activity planning throughout the growing cycle. Data in all tools are updated regularly, even daily in some cases.

U2U is composed of 50 faculty, staff and students from nine universities who specialize in applied climatology, crop modeling, agronomy, cybertechnology, agricultural economics and other social sciences. It is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s[National Institute of Food and Agriculture](http://nifa.usda.gov/).
