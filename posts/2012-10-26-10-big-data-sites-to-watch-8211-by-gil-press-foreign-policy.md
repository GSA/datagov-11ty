Data.gov, which was launched by the Obama administration as part of its [Open Government Initiative](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2009/12/16/changing-way-washington-works) in 2009, offers access to data generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. Enterprising government agencies and private citizens have built on the site’s hundreds of thousands of data sets (and other sources) to help you find everything from the most [on-time flight](http://flyontime.us/) between two airports to the latest [product recalls](http://recalls.gov/).
