The U.S. Government and its partners have been collecting data relevant to the vulnerability of the food system to climate change for over a century. Useful datasets on this topic include the Census of Agriculture, the leading source of facts and figures about American agriculture that is collected every five years for every state and county in the United States. Another key resource is the current and historical data on production, supply and distribution of agricultural commodities for the US and key producing and consuming countries. Climate, including storms, pests, and soils data that influence food production, safety, and supply are also available here. International food security data are provided through Federal and global partnerships.
