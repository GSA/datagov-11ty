The [2018 US National Climate Assessment’s Human Health](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/14/) chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the latest scientific information on the impacts of climate change on public health. Exploring the following resources should provide a greater understanding of the vulnerability to climate change and other stressors.

The [National Air Quality Forecast System](https://www.weather.gov/sti/stimodeling_airquality) provides the US with ozone, particulate matter and other pollutant forecasts with enough accuracy and advance notice to take action to prevent or reduce adverse effects.

The [Food Safety Information](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-safety-information-rss-feed) is produced in real-time by the CDC and results from the integration of the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service and the FDA’s Food Safety Recalls.

The [CDC Emergency Text Messages](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cdc-emergency-text-messages) provides up-to-date information on public health text alerts before and during emergencies.

The [Nutrient and Coliform Loading (NCL)](https://products.coastalscience.noaa.gov/ncl/) is a compilation of available fecal coliform bacteria, fecal streptococci bacteria, and nutrient loading data. Loading for contaminants other than fecal coliform bacteria and nutrients are included when values occurred coincidentally within the same literature. This website can be used to quickly identify available measures of loading from different land use (bacteria and nutrients) and animals (bacteria only). Increasing coastal development causes higher levels of both contaminant types to enter estuaries and affects water quality including both harvestability of shellfish as well as recreational uses.
