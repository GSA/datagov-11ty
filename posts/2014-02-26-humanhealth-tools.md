#### Assessing Health Vulnerability to Climate Change: A Guide for Health Departments
**Sponsor:** HHS-CDC
**Name:** Assessing Health Vulnerability to Climate Change: A Guide for Health Departments
**URL:** [http://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/AssessingHealthVulnerabilitytoClimateChange.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/AssessingHealthVulnerabilitytoClimateChange.pdf)
**Summary:**
This document provides guidance for health departments on how to assess local vulnerabilities to health hazards associated with climate change. A climate and health vulnerability assessment allows health departments to understand the people and places in their jurisdiction that are more susceptible to adverse health impacts associated with climate change. This assessment of people and place vulnerability can then be used to implement targeted public health interventions to reduce the burden of public health impacts.
**How it works:**
Conducting a climate and health vulnerability assessment involves five key steps: 1) determine the scope of the assessment, 2) identify known risk factors for potential health outcomes, 3) acquire spatial information on risk factors, 4) assess adaptive capacity, and 5) conduct an assessment of vulnerability.
**Application:**
This document provides a conceptual framework on how to define vulnerability to climate change, using terms and definitions found in the health and climate change scientific literature. Specifically, we define the term exposure as referring to climate-related exposures such as extreme heat or precipitation.

#### Future Population Estimates (ICLUS – EPA)
**Sponsor:** EPA-Global Change Impacts & Adaptations
**Name:** Future Population Estimates (ICLUS – EPA)
**URL:** [http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/global/recordisplay.cfm?deid=257306](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/global/recordisplay.cfm?deid=257306)
**Summary:**
As a part of the Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios (ICLUS) project, this Geographic Information System (GIS) tool can be used to generate scenarios of housing-density changes and calculate impervious surface cover for the conterminous United States. The ICLUS User’s Guide accompanies the tool. This product distributes the population projections and creates land use data described in the 2009 EPA report “Land-Use Scenarios: National-Scale Housing-Density Scenarios Consistent with Climate Change Storylines”.
**How it works:**
This final report describes the methods used to develop land-use scenarios by decade from the year 2000 to 2100 that are consistent with these storylines. A demographic model feeds population projections into another model that distributes new housing across the landscape. The scenarios cover the 48 contiguous U.S. states.
**Application:**
The ICLUS data provides future population and land-use projections that can be used to assess health vulnerability to climate change.

#### Medical Vulnerability Index – Florida
**Sponsor:** Florida Dept of Health
**Name:** Medical Vulnerability Index – Florida
**URL:** [http://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/climate-and-health/\_documents/climate-sensitive-hazards-in-florida-final-report-3.pdf](https://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/climate-and-health/_documents/climate-sensitive-hazards-in-florida-final-report-3.pdf)
**Summary:**
MedVi is an index that describes medical vulnerability to disasters using social-economic factors combined with health factors. Social characteristics that correlate with health care access include social status, social capital, and human capital. Social indicators of health risk help to identify sensitive populations, the indicators of health need identify individuals and communities with inherent medical vulnerability, independent of ancillary factors. MedVi identifies three dimensions that contribute to a potential for harm: individual medical needs, community healthcare access, and health system capability.
**How it works:**
MedVI used principal components analysis to derive a multidimensional construct of social vulnerability, comprised by the concepts reviewed in the table above. Identifying appropriate data for quantifying medical vulnerability across that state was the first step necessary to create a spatial representation of the theoretical framework.
**Application:**
MedVI can be used to identify communities that are vulnerable to disasters

#### Hurrevac
**Sponsor:**
**Name:** Hurrevac
**URL:** [http://www.hurrevac.com/](https://www.hurrevac.com/)
**Summary:**
HURREVAC (short for Hurricane Evacuation) is a storm tracking and decision support tool. The program combines live feeds of tropical cyclone forecast information with data from various state Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) to assist the local emergency manager in determining the most prudent evacuation decision time and the potential for significant storm effects such as wind and storm surge. Note that in order to qualify for HURREVAC use, you must be an active member of the government emergency management community.
**How it works:**
HURREVAC tracks hurricanes using the National Hurricane Center’s Forecast Advisories. The software translates forecast track and wind extent information from the NHC’s text-based products into interactive maps and reports that are used to chart the progress of an advancing storm. The program also assembles rainfall, flood, tide, and river forecast information from various sources to assist users in evaluating inland flooding threat
**Application:**
HURREVAC arrives at an evacuation decision time using input from the official hurricane forecast and the Hurricane Evacuation Study for the county or parish of interest.

#### Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service
**Sponsor:** NWS
**Name:** Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service
**URL:** [http://water.weather.gov/ahps/](https://water.weather.gov/ahps/)
**Summary:**
The Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) is a web-based suite of accurate and information-rich forecast products from the National Weather Service that display the magnitude and uncertainty of the occurrence of floods or droughts, from hours to days and months in advance. These graphical products are useful information and planning tools for economic and emergency managers and enable government agencies, private institutions, and individuals to make more informed decisions about risk-based policies and actions to mitigate the dangers posed by floods and droughts.
**How it works:**
Using sophisticated computer models and large amounts of data from a wide variety of sources—such as super computers, automated gauges, geostationary satellites, Doppler radars, weather observation stations, and the computer and communications system known as the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System—the National Weather Service provides hydrologic forecasts for almost 4,000 locations across the United States.
**Application:**
Products are useful information and planning tools for economic and emergency managers and enable government agencies, private institutions, and individuals to make more informed decisions about risk-based policies and actions to mitigate the dangers posed by floods and droughts.
