A [supplemental guide](http://project-open-data.github.io/implementation-guide/) to the White House’s Open Data Policy has been released providing additional clarification and detailed requirements to assist agencies in carrying out the objectives laid out in a May 9 [memo and executive order](http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/white-house-releases-open-data-policy/2013-05-09).


The administration’s document, posted on the GitHub website, focuses on near-term efforts agencies must take to meet the five initial requirements of [OMB Memorandum M-13-13](http://www.whitehouse.gov) (.pdf), which are due November 1, 2013.
