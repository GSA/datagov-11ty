title: Your Open Data Story

Open government data enables us to create tools that deliver insights on topics ranging from education and health to entrepreneurship and foreign aid. Families reviewing college options can compare tuition, graduation rates, and potential post-graduation salaries, using the [College Scorecard](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard)– an application built with Department of Education data. By analyzing CDC [data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cdc-wonder-mortality-infant-deaths) on infant mortality and the USDA’s [Food Access Research Atlas](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/go-to-the-atlas.aspx), researchers can study the relationship between a city’s infant mortality rates and citizens’ access to healthy food options- add on [data](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/data/datasets.html) from the U.S. Census Bureau, and those same researchers can tell a story about how a family’s annual household income may determine a newborn’s health outlook. A maker of personalized key chains can use the Social Security Administration’s Popular Baby Names [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data) to predict which names on key chains will sell the most per U.S. state- in California, Noah was the most popular male name while Sophia was the most popular female name for the years 2014 and 2015. How much in U.S. Foreign Aid was allocated to [Mexico](http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/explore) for the fiscal year 2015? Foreignassistance.gov has the answer.
