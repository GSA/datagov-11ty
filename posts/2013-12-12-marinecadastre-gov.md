MarineCadastre.gov is a joint Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initiative that provides authoritative data to meet the needs of the offshore energy and marine planning communities. The website provides access to authoritative data from multiple agencies, including offshore boundaries and physical, biological, ocean use, and cultural information. Users can create, view, and print maps from this free, easy-to-use viewer, or can directly link to the web map services through their own GIS applications.
